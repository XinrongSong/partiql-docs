## partiql-docs

This repository contains PartiQL-related technical documents including design docs, use cases etc. Feel free to ask questions and/or propose clarifications, and we'll do our best to respond quickly.

There are three primary subdirectories:

### [`/docs`](docs)

This subdirectory contains documents that have been accepted by the PartiQL team as correct. The information here should reflect the current understanding of PartiQL.

### [`/drafts`](drafts)

This subdirectory contains working versions of documents in various stages of development. While these documents are probably useful, be aware the information might be outdated or wrong.

### [`/deprecated`](deprecated)

This subdirectory contains documents that have been abandoned. When `drafts` are not moved to `docs`, they should be moved here. The docs here may be useful for learning the thoughts and considerations of past attempts, but there is no guarantee on the correctness.
